After accompanying Lady Wang to have her meal and seeing to her ablutions, Ping'er made her way to the residence of Third Miss Tan Chun. Upon arrival, she found the courtyard unusually quiet, with only the maids and matrons standing outside the window, awaiting orders. Entering the hall, she saw Tan Chun, Lady Li, and Miss Baochai engaged in a discussion about household affairs. The topic at hand was the incident at Lai's family garden during the New Year banquet. Upon seeing Ping'er, Tan Chun invited her to sit on a footstool and said, "What I've been thinking about is not of great significance, but it concerns the two taels of silver allocated each month for our personal expenses, such as hair oils and cosmetics. We already receive a monthly allowance of two taels, and the maids have their own monthly wages. Isn't this redundant, just like the eight taels at the school? It doesn't seem quite right, and I wonder why my aunt hasn't considered this."

Ping'er smiled and explained, "There is a reason for this arrangement. The items you ladies use are supposed to be provided according to a set quota. Every month, the purchasing agents buy them and hand them over to us for safekeeping, just in case you need them. It's not practical for each of you to go out and buy these things with your own money every day. Therefore, the agents collect the funds and distribute the items to us monthly. As for the two taels each of you receives, it's not actually for buying these items. It's more like a petty cash fund in case the head of the household, be it a lady or a madam, is away or too busy. It's meant to prevent you from feeling inconvenienced or wronged. Lately, I've noticed that in many of the rooms, the young ladies are still buying these items with their own money. I suspect either the agents are pocketing the money or they're buying substandard goods."

Tan Chun and Lady Li both laughed and said, "You've been observant too. There's no embezzlement, but the goods often arrive late. When pressed, they somehow manage to get some items, but they're mostly just for show and not really usable. We still have to buy our own, using the two taels, and have someone else's wet nurse's brother or son do the shopping to get something decent. If we use the official staff, it's the same old story. I wonder what tricks they're using."

Ping'er replied with a smile, "The agents buy those inferior goods on purpose. If someone else buys better quality items, the agents won't allow it and will accuse them of having ulterior motives, trying to take over their position. So, they'd rather offend the people inside than those outside who are handling the affairs. If the young ladies use their wet nurses, the agents wouldn't dare to complain."

Tan Chun said, "That's precisely what bothers me. We're wasting money and half of the goods are still unusable. It would be better to abolish this monthly expense for the agents. That's the first thing. The second thing is about our visit to Lai's family during the New Year. You were there too, right? How does their small garden compare to ours?"

Ping'er laughed and said, "It's not even half as large as ours, and they have far fewer trees and flowers."

Tan Chun continued, "I was chatting with the girls from their family and learned that aside from the flowers they grow and the bamboo shoots, fish, and shrimp they harvest, their garden still yields enough to make two hundred taels of silver a year. It was then that I realized even a withered lotus leaf or a dead reed is valuable."

Baochai laughed and said, "What a worldly conversation! Although you are all ladies of privilege and may not be familiar with such matters, haven't you read Zhu Xi's essay on 'not giving up on oneself'? It's meant to encourage self-improvement and is not just empty words."

Tan Chun replied with a smile, "I have read it, but it seems more like a motivational piece with little practical relevance. Where is the real substance in it?"

Baochai countered, "Are you saying Zhu Xi's words are empty? Every sentence has meaning. You've only been in charge of affairs for two days, and already you're blinded by profit, questioning the value of Zhu Xi's teachings. If you continue like this, you'll start doubting even Confucius."

Tan Chun laughed and said, "You, being so knowledgeable, haven't read the works of Ji Zi? He once said: 'Those who enter the arena of profit and strategy, even if they quote the words of Yao and Shun, will go against the teachings of Confucius and Mencius.'"

Baochai asked with a smile, "What about the next sentence?"

Tan Chun replied, "I'm using a phrase out of context. If I were to quote the next sentence, wouldn't I be criticizing myself?"

Baochai said, "There is no object in the world that is useless. If it can be used, it has value. It's surprising that you, being so intelligent, have not yet grasped this fundamental principle."

Lady Li interjected with a laugh, "You've called her here, but instead of discussing the main issue, you're engaging in scholarly debates!"

Baochai responded, "Scholarship is the essence of the matter. Without it, everything would become vulgar and mundane."

After a round of playful banter, the three returned to their main topic. Tan Chun continued, "Our garden, even if we consider it to be only half as large as theirs, could potentially yield four hundred taels of silver a year if we double the calculation. It would be petty for us to start making money from it now, which is not befitting of our family's stature. However, if we simply assign two specific people to take care of it, there are many valuable things in the garden that could be ruined if left unattended, which would be a waste. Instead of letting them go to waste, we should select a few reliable and experienced old matrons from the garden staff to manage and tend to it. We don't need them to pay rent or taxes; we just need to know what they can contribute annually. This way, first, the garden will have dedicated caretakers, and it will improve year by year without last-minute scrambles. Second, the valuable items won't be wasted. Third, the old matrons can benefit a little from their efforts, rewarding them for their years of hard work in the garden. Fourth, we can save on the wages of the gardeners, landscapers, and cleaners. By using the surplus to cover the shortages, it seems like a viable plan."

Baochai, who was examining the calligraphy and paintings on the wall, nodded with a smile and said, "Well said! 'Within three years, there will be no famine.'"

Lady Li added, "What a wonderful idea! If we implement this, Madam will surely be pleased. Saving money is a minor matter, but having the garden well-maintained with designated responsibilities and allowing them to profit from it will ensure their dedication. Empowering them with authority and motivating them with benefits will surely lead to better performance."

Ping'er interjected, "This idea must come from the young ladies. Although our madam has the intention, it might be difficult for her to propose it directly. With the young ladies living in the garden, it wouldn't be appropriate to suggest sending people to manage and repair it just to save money. Such a suggestion would be hard to make."

Baochai walked over and playfully touched Ping'er's face, saying, "Let me see what your teeth and tongue are made of. Since early morning, you've been speaking in different ways. You neither flatter Third Miss nor say that your madam lacks the wit to think of such things. For every suggestion Third Miss makes, you have a corresponding response, making it seem as if everything Third Miss thinks of, your madam has also considered, but there must be some insurmountable reason. Now you're saying it's hard to propose because the young ladies live in the garden. Think about it, if it were truly about making money, that person would naturally not allow a single flower to be picked or a single fruit to be moved. The young ladies, of course, wouldn't dare to complain, but there would be endless quarrels with the younger girls every day. Your far-sightedness and humility would make even someone who isn't on good terms with us feel ashamed and strive to improve."

Tan Chun laughed and said, "I was quite upset this morning, but when she arrived, I suddenly thought of her mistress: such a wild and unruly person when in charge! Seeing her made me even angrier. But then she came in, timid as a mouse avoiding a cat, standing there for a long while, looking so pitiful. Then she said those words, not praising her mistress for treating me well, but saying, 'It's not in vain that the young lady has always been kind to our madam.' With just that one sentence, not only did my anger dissipate, but I felt ashamed and even saddened. I reflected on myself: as a girl, I'm already neglected and uncared for. Where have I ever shown any kindness to others?" As she spoke, tears began to flow. Li Wan and the others, thinking of her usual plight with Zhao Yanniang's constant slander and the burden it placed on
